## About
### Me
Hello friend, I am Stalin Badillo, I am a software developer and an eternal student.  

I learn and improve every day to become a great software engineer and gain more experience in many other technologies as time goes on.

 My goal is to create technological innovation to solve problems and build the future of our dreams.

With my co-workers I try to do excellent teamwork and maintain beneficial social relationships.

### The repositories
Here you will find projects on many things I have done so far. I used concepts about animation, transitions, methodologies like BEM and patterns like: 
* layout shifter 
* mobile-first 
* responsive design 

CSS layouts like 
* flex.
* grid 

JavaScript, SCSS code and much more.

Now, I put my works and experiments at your fingertips.
